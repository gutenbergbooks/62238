<span class="GutSmall">TO THE</span><br />
<i>EIGHTH EDITION</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following little Work was
originally published in the Spring of 1804, under the assumed
name of Theophilus Christian, Esq.&nbsp; From the high
commendation bestowed on it by the late Bishop Porteus, the
Author was induced to avow himself in the second impression, and
to prefix a Dedication, in which he endeavoured to do some
justice to the merits of that Prelate, whose character he united
with the public in revering, and whose patronage and friendship
he had the honour to enjoy.</p>
<p><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>The
Author is not insensible to the degree of improvement in the
general tone of society, which has rendered certain strictures on
the grosser qualities of a Fashionable character, somewhat less
appropriate than they were at the period of their first
publication.&nbsp; He wishes, however, he could convince himself,
that the improvement to which he alludes, and of which he desires
to speak with becoming respect, were not to be interpreted as
originating more in <i>humour</i> than in <i>principle</i>, and
as indicating rather the progress of refinement than the
influence of virtue.&nbsp; The peccant evil, he is sorry to
observe, continues to exist; and, however the form of its
operation may have been varied, its spirit remains the
same.&nbsp; <a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>On this account, it did not appear to the Author
expedient to tamper with his text.&nbsp; He felt persuaded that
its application will be found sufficiently accurate for every
practical purpose; and he could not consent to weaken its force
by over-scrupulous concessions to the pleadings of candour, or
the requirements of temporary accommodation.</p>
<p>If an apology should be thought necessary for the little place
which has been allowed for remarks of a purely religious
description, that apology will be furnished by the nature and
design of the Work.&nbsp; To produce a disaffection to a life of
sense, with all its blandishments, and under all its
modifications, was the end which the <a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>Author proposed to himself; and his
means were chosen with a reference to that end.&nbsp; In whatever
degree he may succeed in effecting it, he will think that he has
gained no ordinary point; inasmuch as they who despair of
happiness in the ways of sin, are so far prepared to embrace that
godliness, which is &ldquo;profitable unto all things, having
promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to
come.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> often been surprised, that
among the many descriptions which ingenious writers have given of
places and people comparatively insignificant, no complete and
systematic account has yet been written of the Fashionable
World.&nbsp; It is true, that our poets and caricaturists have
honoured this people with a great share of their notice, and many
particulars, not a little edifying, have been made known, through
the medium of their admirable publications.&nbsp; It is also
true, that our <a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>prose-writers have occasionally cast a very pertinent
glance over this fairy ground.&nbsp; Some of these latter have
even gone so far, as to write absolute treatises upon certain
parts of the Fashionable character.&nbsp; Mrs. More, for example,
has delineated the religion, and Lord Chesterfield the morals, of
this singular people with the greatest exactness and
precision.&nbsp; Nor would it be just to overlook the very
acceptable labours of those writers who, in their Court-calendars
and Court-almanacks, bring us acquainted, from time to time, with
the modes of dress which prevail in the Fashionable World, and
the names of its most distinguished inhabitants.&nbsp; But after
all that has been done, towards exhibiting the manners, and
unfolding the character, <a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>of this splendid community, much
remains to be done: for though certain details have been well
enough handled, yet I repeat, that a complete and systematic
account of the Fashionable World, is still a desideratum in
Cosmography.</p>
<p>I am far from pretending to either the ability or the design
of supplying this deficiency.&nbsp; The utmost that I propose to
myself, is to bring more particulars into a group, than former
writers have done; and to exhibit an outline, upon which others
of more enlarged experience may improve.&nbsp; It seems to me of
great importance to the interests of society, that its members
should be known to each other: and of this I am persuaded, that
if there be one description <a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>of people, the knowledge of whose
genuine character would be more edifying to mankind than another,
it is&mdash;the people of Fashion.</p>

class="GutSmall">SITUATION&mdash;BOUNDARIES&mdash;CLIMATE&mdash;SEASONS.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> I do not undertake to write
a geographical account of the Fashionable World, yet I should
think myself highly culpable were I to pass over this interesting
part of the subject wholly in silence.&nbsp; My readers must be
at the same time cautioned, not to form their expectations of the
geography of <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>Fashion from that of other countries.&nbsp; The fact is,
that the whole community which sustains this appellation,
extensive as it is, can scarcely be treated as having any
peculiar or exclusive locality.&nbsp; The individuals who compose
it, are not, it is true, absolute wanderers, like the tribes of
Arabia; nor yet are they regular settlers, like the convicts at
Botany Bay: but moveable and migratory to a certain degree, and
to a certain degree stationary and permanent, they live among the
inhabitants of the parent country; neither absolutely mixing with
them, nor yet actually separated from them.</p>
<p>This paradoxical state of the people renders it not a little
difficult to reduce their <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>territory within the rules of
geographical description.&nbsp; They have, it is true, their
<i>degrees</i> and their <i>circles</i>; but these terms are used
by people of Fashion in a sense so different from that which
geographers have assigned them, that they afford no sort of
assistance to the topographical enquirer.&nbsp; It is, I presume,
on this account, that in all the improvements which have been
made upon the globe, nothing has been done towards settling the
meridian of Fashion; and though the Laplanders, the Hottentots,
and the Esquimaux, have places assigned them, no more notice is
taken of the people of Fashion, than if they either did not
exist, or were not worthy of being mentioned.</p>
<p>The only expedient, therefore, to which <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>a writer can
resort, in this dearth of geographical materials, is that of
designating the territory of Fashion by the ordinary names of the
several places through which it passes.&nbsp; And this is, in
fact, strictly conformable to that usage which prevails in the
language and communication of the people themselves: for London,
Tunbridge, Bath, Weymouth, &amp;c. are, in their mouths, names
for little else than the lands and societies of Fashion which
they respectively contain.</p>
<p>Now, the portion of each place to which Fashion lays claim, is
neither definite as to its dimensions, nor fixed as to its
locality.&nbsp; In London, a small proportion of the whole is
Fashionable; in Bath, the proportion is greater; and in some
watering-places of the <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>latest creation, Fashion puts in her
demand for nearly the whole.&nbsp; The locality of its domains is
also contingent and mutable.&nbsp; Various circumstances concur
in determining, when a portion of ground shall become
Fashionable, and when it shall cease to be such.&nbsp; The only
rule of any steadiness with which I am acquainted, and which
chiefly relates to the metropolis, is that which prescribes a
<i>western</i> latitude: <a name="citation5"></a><a
href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a> if this be excepted,
(which indeed admits of no relaxation,) events of very little
moment decide all the rest.&nbsp; If, for example, a Duchess, or
the wife of some bourgeois-gentilhomme, <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>who has purchased the privileges of
the order, should open a suite of rooms for elegant society in
any new quarter, the soil is considered to receive a sort of
consecration by such a circumstance; and an indefinite portion of
the vicinity is added to the territory of Fashion.&nbsp; If, on
the other hand, a shop be opened, a sign hung out, or any symptom
of business be shewn, in a quarter that has hitherto been a
stranger to every sound but the rattling of carriages, the
thunder of knockers, and the vociferation of coachmen and
servants, it is ten to one but the privileges of Fashion are
withdrawn from that place; and the whole range of buildings is
gradually given up to those, who are either needy enough to keep
shops, or vulgar enough to endure them.&nbsp; Now, it <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>happens as a
consequence from this adoption of new soil and disfranchisement
of old, that the territory of Fashion is extremely irregular and
interrupted.&nbsp; A traveller, determined to pursue its
windings, would soon be involved in a most mysterious labyrinth;
his track would be crossed by portions of country which throw him
repeatedly out of his beat: insomuch that his progress would
resemble that of a naturalist, who, in tracing the course of a
mineral through the bowels of the earth, encounters various
breaks and intersections, and often finds the corresponding parts
of the same stratum unaccountably separated from each other.</p>
<p>It would be only fatiguing the reader to <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>say more upon
the topographical part of my subject.&nbsp; It is obvious, from
what has been stated, that the regions of Fashion, considered as
a whole, are rather numerous than compact: and, indeed, such
difference of opinion subsists among the people themselves upon
the territories which are entitled to that name, that no correct
judgment can be pronounced upon a question of so great
controversy.&nbsp; Thus much, however, may be affirmed, that
there is scarcely a market-town in the kingdom, in which some
portion of land is not invested with Fashionable privileges; and
designated by such terms, as mark the wish of the inhabitants, to
have it considered as forming part and parcel of the demesnes of
Fashion.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>The
<i>Climate</i> of Fashion is almost entirely factitious and
artificial; and consequently differs in many material respects
from the natural temperature of those several places over which
its jurisdiction extends.&nbsp; Though changes from heat to cold,
and vice versa, are very common among these people, yet heat may
be said to be the prevailing character of the climate.&nbsp; They
appear to me to have but two Seasons in the year; these they
call, in conformity to ordinary language, rather than to just
calculation, Winter and Summer.&nbsp; Of Summer little is known:
for it seems to be a rule among this people, to disband and
disperse at the approach of it; and not to rally or re-unite,
till the Winter has fairly commenced.&nbsp; Though, therefore,
they exist <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>somehow or somewhere, <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a> during the Summer
months; they wish it to be considered, that they do not exist
under their Fashionable <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>character.&nbsp; They wash themselves
in the sea, drink laxative waters, lose a little money at
billiards, or catch a few colds at public rooms; but all these
things they do as individuals, and wholly out of their corporate
capacity as members <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>of the community of Fashion.&nbsp; So that in their mode
of disposing of the Summer, they invert the standing rule of most
other animals; they choose the fair season for their torpid
state, and shew no signs of life but during the Winter.&nbsp; It
is not easy to say exactly when the Winter <i>begins</i> in the
Fashionable World; an inhabitant of Bath would have one mode of
reckoning, and an inhabitant of London another.&nbsp; To do
justice to the subject, the commencement of Winter ought to be
regulated by the former of these places, and the close of it by
the latter.&nbsp; Supposing, therefore, that it begins some time
in November, there can be no difficulty in settling its duration;
for the 4th of June <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a> is, by a tacit yet
binding ordinance, <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>considered as a limit, which a Fashionable Winter can
seldom, if ever, exceed.</p>
<p>There are many circumstances in which the Climate of Fashion
stands peculiarly distinguished from every other.&nbsp; It has
already been intimated that heat is its prevailing
characteristic: it is, moreover, not a little remarkable, that
this heat is at its highest point in the Winter season; and that
the inhabitants often perspire more freely when the snow is upon
the ground, than they do in the dog-days.&nbsp; The truth is,
that, as was before said, the Climate is wholly created by
artificial circumstances, and the natural temperature of the air
is completely done away.&nbsp; The sort of communication which
these people keep up <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>with each other, is considered to
require a species of apparatus which fills their atmosphere with
an immoderate degree of phlogiston.&nbsp; Besides this, they are
notoriously fond of assembling in insufferable crowds; and
travellers have assured us, that they have often witnessed from
ten to twelve hundred persons suffocating each other, within a
space which would scarcely have afforded convenient accommodation
for a dozen families.&nbsp; And this may enable us in some
measure to account for the little benefit which modish invalids
are said to derive from their frequent removals to the healthiest
spots in the universe.&nbsp; The original object of such a
prescription was doubtless to change the air; and certainly no
expedient could have been better imagined for bracing <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>a
constitution relaxed by too intense application to the business
of a Fashionable life.&nbsp; But the usages of the order render a
change of air, to any salutary purpose, utterly impracticable:
for the weakest members of the community consider themselves
bound to kindle a flame wherever they go; and thus they breathe
the same phlogisticated air all over the world.</p>
<p>They profess to adopt the ordinary divisions of time; and they
talk like other people of <i>Day</i> and <i>Night</i>: but their
mode of computing each is so vague and unnatural, that
inhabitants of the same meridian with themselves scarcely
understand what they mean by the terms.&nbsp; A great part of
this difficulty may possibly arise from the very <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>small portion
of solar light with which they are visited.&nbsp; For certain it
is, that no people upon earth have less benefit from the light of
the sun than the people of Fashion; so that if it were not for
torches, candles, and lamps, they would scarcely ever see each
other&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>With regard to the constitutions of these people, I have been
inclined to think them naturally robust, from observing the
astonishing heat and fatigue which they are accustomed to
endure.&nbsp; And in this respect the women have appeared to
evince an uncommon degree of hardiness: for, besides that they
wear on every occasion a lighter species of clothing than the
men, I have been confidently told that many among <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>them will
appear, in the severest part of the season, with dresses of such
transparency and scantiness, as convince every beholder that they
who wear them are utter strangers to the weaknesses of the
sex.&nbsp; There is, however, some room for doubting, whether the
air which this people breathe, and the usages which prevail among
them, are favorable to the constitution.&nbsp; Their patience of
fatigue has been thought to be wholly the result of habit, and
their hardiness has been conjectured to be little more than an
air of extravagance and bravado.&nbsp; The frequent transitions
which they make from heat to cold, and back again from cold to
heat; perhaps half-a-dozen times in as many hours; must very
materially diminish the physical <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>strength of their bodies.&nbsp;
Certain it is, that their natural countenances do not betray the
usual symptoms of health; and it is, I believe, admitted, that
instances of extraordinary longevity are not very common among
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> History of the Fashionable
World is a sort of undertaking, which, to be accurately executed,
would require abundantly more leisure and diligence than I could
afford to bestow upon it: and I very much doubt, whether, after
all, one reader out of a hundred would be at the pains of
perusing it.&nbsp; The fact is, that the members of this
community are not sufficiently substantial to form historical
pictures.&nbsp; Their employments are not of a nature to make
their memory an object with mankind.&nbsp; Hence, though they
make a splendid appearance <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>in a ball-room, they appear to little
advantage in a record; and, like the dancing figures in a
magic-lantern, they seem to have answered the end of their being,
when they have afforded an evening&rsquo;s amusement.&nbsp; For
these and other reasons which might be assigned, I shall content
myself with giving a brief account of their Polity and Laws;
referring those of my readers who are desirous of further
information upon their history, to Novels and Romances, and to
such Chronicles of antiquity, as have preserved the memorials of
obsolete and superannuated manners.</p>
<p>It is a task of no ordinary difficulty to convey any tolerable
idea of this people, in their aggregate or national
capacity.&nbsp; Consisting, <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>as they do, of various and detached
societies, they are yet considered to possess a sort of federal
relation among each other; and to unite into an imaginary whole,
under the collective denomination of the Fashionable World.&nbsp;
It is under this aggregate character that they take their rank in
society; and the appellation which denotes their community, is
recognised by the tradesmen who advertise for their custom, and
the politicians who discourse of their affairs.&nbsp; A very
handsome proportion of the daily newspapers is devoted to their
service; and intelligence from their drawing-rooms is reported
with as much regularity as that which is derived from the first
cabinets in Europe.&nbsp; Indeed, the minuteness with which their
routs and dances, their dresses and <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>dainties, the expressions they utter,
the company they keep, and the excesses they commit, are
detailed, is at once an evidence that these people are considered
to have a corporate existence; and that no little consequence is
attached to their proceedings.&nbsp; I wish, with all my heart,
that they thought a little more of this; they would then scarcely
run into such extravagancies, as make them, on too many
occasions, objects of ridicule to one part of society, and
dangerous examples to the other.</p>
<p>Their <i>Population</i> is more fluctuating and uncertain than
that of any people upon the face of the earth.&nbsp; There are
among them certain tribes, or families, distinguished by
different descendable titles, who are said to <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>claim a sort
of prescriptive right to the name of Fashionables.&nbsp; In these
the federal appellation continues hereditary; and it is an axiom
among the body, that people of <i>Quality</i> (for this is the
term by which they designate the titled gentry) can never be out
of Fashion.</p>
<p>This is, it must be observed, their <i>own</i> representation
of the matter; and I am inclined to suspect that there is no
little management at the bottom of it.&nbsp; There is something,
no doubt, very splendid in the idea of including all the families
of rank within the limits of Fashion; and it is a mark of no
contemptible policy, to have constructed an axiom which so
effectually cuts off their retreat.&nbsp; But surely, it would <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>be but decent
to allow the gentry of the realm to have a voice in the
business.&nbsp; There <i>have been</i> times, in which many of
our Nobles would have thought themselves dishonoured by being
presumed of course to sustain a Fashionable character.&nbsp; I
cannot but think, that if the modern nobility were fairly
consulted, several of them would <i>still</i> be found to
entertain the same opinion; and that persons of the first
distinction in the country would be among that number.</p>
<p>However that be, these dignified families are, according to
Fashionable computation, almost the only standing members of the
community; and, if these be excepted, all the rest of their body
is mutable in the extreme.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>There
is a perpetual reciprocation of numbers between them and the
society in which they reside.&nbsp; Scarcely an hour passes
without some interchange.&nbsp; The gossip of every day announces
that some have migrated from the region of Fashion, and that
others have made their appearance within it for the first
time.&nbsp; The causes which produce these variations, and the
reasons by which they are defended, are in some instances too
mysterious, and in others too frivolous, to become subjects of
recital.&nbsp; In general it may be affirmed, that though persons
become Fashionable <i>with</i> the concurrence of their will,
they cease to be such <i>against</i> it.&nbsp; For, if a few
accidental converts to plain sense and sober piety be excepted,
the greater part of those who retire have been <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>superseded;
and resign their places, only because they cannot any longer
retain them.&nbsp; However that be, the fluctuation thus
occasioned in the numbers and characters of those who compose
this Fashionable Community, diversifies its complexion daily; and
renders a precise account of its population and totality utterly
impossible.</p>
<p>The form of government subsisting among this people, so far as
it can be traced out, is Oligarchical, and the spirit of it is
absolute and despotical.&nbsp; The few in whose hands the supreme
authority resides, do not consist of any regular or definite
number, nor are they confined to any particular sex.&nbsp; In
general, they are composed of persons out of both sexes, who,
while they exercise a <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>separate influence in things relating
to the sexes respectively, possess also a common jurisdiction in
matters of universal concern.</p>
<p>The governing few are not invested with their authority by any
formalities of law; nor do they obtain their station by any
specific qualifications.&nbsp; The magistracy which they hold,
appears to be neither hereditary nor elective, but
contingent.&nbsp; The term of their continuance in power is also
as indefinite and capricious, as the right by which they acquire
it.&nbsp; One thing, however, is certain, that as a moral
reputation has no influence in recommending them to the stations
they fill, so the forfeiture of it in no degree weakens the
stability, or abridges the duration of their power.&nbsp; That a
government <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>of this independent description should exist in the
heart of the British empire, an <i>imperium in imperio</i>, will
appear scarcely credible to my reader.&nbsp; He may, however,
rely upon it, that the fact is as I have stated it; and if he
should express his wonder, that such contempt of the sovereign
authority as it eventually leads to, has not been properly
resisted, he will only do what thousands have done before
him.</p>
<p>But to return:&mdash;The laws by which the government of
Fashion is administered, like the common law of England, are
unwritten; and derive their force, as that does, from usage and
prescription.&nbsp; The only code of any note among this people,
is that which they distinguish by the collective appellation <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>of the LAW of
HONOUR.&nbsp; This extraordinary code has been defined to
be&mdash;&ldquo;a system of rules constructed by people of
Fashion, and calculated to facilitate their intercourse with one
another.&rdquo; <a name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a>&nbsp; Now if this definition be a just
one, (and I presume it is, from the high authority by which it is
given,) it will afford us no indifferent help, towards unfolding
the mysteries of Fashionable jurisprudence.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that the <i>Law of Honour</i>, by which people
of Fashion are said to be governed, is wholly and exclusively
designed to make them acceptable to each other.&nbsp; Now, not to
mention other things, persons in a Fashionable sphere cannot be
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>strictly
agreeable to each other, unless they are well dressed; nor can
that intercourse which they chiefly value, be pleasantly
maintained, without splendid equipages, choice wines, and
sumptuous entertainments.&nbsp; As, therefore, the necessity of
the case requires such accommodations, the <i>Law of Honour</i>,
to say the least, does not look very nicely into the means by
which they may have been procured.&nbsp; Hence it follows, by the
fairest inference, that a man of Fashion is not at all the less
respectable in his own circle, merely because he is what the rest
of the world calls unjust.&nbsp; For, whatever may be the law
elsewhere, a man of Fashion can owe nothing to his inferiors: and
his character will therefore suffer no stain, though he should
have broken his <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>word a thousand times with the reptile that made his
clothes, built his carriage, or furnished his table.</p>
<p>This law is also distinguished by many other features of
toleration, which well account for the respect and influence that
it possesses in the Fashionable World.&nbsp; By a spirit of
accommodation, of which there is no other example, it overlooks,
if it does not even encourage, a variety of actions, which in the
mouth of a moralist would be absolute vices; and which, to say
the truth, are scarcely deserving of a much better name.&nbsp;
Thus, a man may debauch his tenant&rsquo;s daughter, seduce the
wife of his friend, and be faithless, and even brutal to his own,
and yet be esteemed a man of honour, <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>(which is the same as a man of
Fashion,) and have a right to make any man fight him who says he
is not.&nbsp; In like manner, a man may blaspheme God, and
encourage his children and servants to do the same; he may
neglect the interests, and squander the property, of his family;
he may be a tyrant in his house, and a bully in the streets; he
may lie a-bed all day, and drink and game all night; and yet be a
most dutiful subject of the <i>Law of Honour</i>, and a shining
character in the society of Fashion.</p>
<p>There is, I own, much convenience in all this, and some
consistency.&nbsp; Persons who live only for this world, should
have a proportionable latitude allowed them for the <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>employment of
their animal propensities; and the law which provides for the
regulation of their conduct, should have a special reference to
this consideration.&nbsp; Supposing, therefore, that people of
Fashion ought to exist, they must have such a law as that which
they possess.&nbsp; So that, taking the Law of Honour in this
connexion, I cannot but think it a master-piece of political
contrivance.</p>
<p>At the same time, I cannot agree with those who have been led
to consider this table of Fashionable jurisprudence as deserving
a place in the temple of Morality.&nbsp; Into this error a
celebrated writer appears to have fallen, in his Treatise of
Moral Philosophy.&nbsp; For, having defined morality to <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>be
&ldquo;that science which teaches men their duty, and the reasons
of it,&rdquo; he proceeds to cite the <i>Law of Honour</i> as one
of the three rules by which men are governed.&nbsp; That
respectable writer has, indeed, admitted that this law is
<i>defective</i>, because it does not provide for the duties to
God and to inferiors; he has also proclaimed that it is
<i>bad</i>, by stating, that it allows of fornication, adultery,
drunkenness, prodigality, duelling, &amp;c.&nbsp; Still, however,
he has rather left us to infer, that it ought wholly to be
rejected, than absolutely told us so.&nbsp; By classing it with
the law of the land and the Scriptures, he has (undesignedly no
doubt) prevented its utter condemnation; and afforded ground for
considering it as a moral rule, to which men owe a qualified
obedience.</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Having
specified the sort of practices which the <i>Law of Honour</i>
allows, I shall take some brief notice of the duties which it
exacts.&nbsp; The principal of these, and that upon which its
tone and spirit are most peremptory, is the <i>resentment of
injuries</i>.&nbsp; Now it must be observed, that the term
<i>injury</i>, in the use of people of Fashion, is of a very wide
and comprehensive signification.&nbsp; It not only means such an
act of outrage as amounts to a manifest and palpable wrong, but
extends to every dubious point of conduct, from which a
Fashionable sophist could find scope to infer an injurious
intention.&nbsp; Thus a sister seduced, and then abandoned, and a
word or a look not satisfactorily explained, are all equally
injuries; and constitute, in the spirit <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>of this code,
so many obligations to the most lively and implacable
resentment.&nbsp; It may be, that the offended person is of a
peaceable disposition, and would rather endure a moderate injury
than revenge it; or he may have too much respect for the laws of
the parent state, to require or accept redress in any other than
the legal way; or he may know, that the offending party is a man
disposed to seek a quarrel, and that he desires nothing so much
as to provoke the innocent person, whom he has purposely
insulted, to claim satisfaction; or, lastly, it may be, that the
supposed injury is founded wholly on mistake, and that the
reputed aggressor will not believe or own himself to have
offended, and will therefore make no atonement.&nbsp; In all
these cases, personal <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>resentment might as well be waved;
but this the Law of Honour positively forbids: and he who should
conscientiously decline to pursue a personal quarrel, upon these,
or even higher motives, might be a better father, a better
husband, a better subject, and a better Christian, for so doing;
but he would certainly be a worse man of honour.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that these reputed injuries are
sometimes so minute and transitory, or so remote and obscure,
that, if every thing depended upon the aggressor and the
aggrieved, they would either remain wholly undiscovered, or, at
least, be speedily forgotten.&nbsp; But each of these
consequences is not unfrequently defeated by the officious
industry of some kind-hearted <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>being, who, though he loves his
friend too well to let him be insulted, can govern his feelings
well enough to stand by and see him murdered.&nbsp; This is,
certainly, a refinement upon the theory of friendship, which may
be fairly set down among the most extraordinary achievements of
the <i>Law of Honour</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, this bloody code has many
such refinements.&nbsp; For, proceeding, as it does, upon
principles of its own invention, it must necessarily clash with
many antecedent obligations.&nbsp; These, however, it contrives,
by the help of a little sophistry, so to supersede, that neither
affinity nor attachment may impede the progress of honourable
revenge: and hence we see, in compliance with its rigid edicts,
the warmest friends sacrifice to resentment with <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>as little
reserve as the bitterest enemies; and that, perhaps, to settle a
tavern dispute, or to avenge a play-house quarrel!</p>
<p>Having said so much of the principal duty enjoined by the Law
of Honour, I shall offer a few observations upon the sort of
punishment which it inflicts.&nbsp; I trust I shall be excused,
if, in treating this part of my subject, I employ the term
<i>punishment</i> in a sense not strictly similar to that in
which it is ordinarily used.&nbsp; The fact is, that this
singular law makes the parties both judges in their own cause,
and executioners of their own sentence.&nbsp; The universal award
against every convicted offender is, that he shall fight a duel
with the offended party.&nbsp; So that, if that may be set <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>down as
punishment, which is ultimate in a controversy, and which is
exacted as a satisfaction to the law; death, or exposure to it,
is the lowest punishment which honour inflicts upon the least
offender; and the highest which it enforces upon the
greatest.</p>
<p>And this is, I confess, a political incongruity, which I have
not a little difficulty in reconciling with the good sense of
many who have undertaken to defend it.&nbsp; The law of England
has often been blamed (and I think with justice) as unreasonably
sanguinary.&nbsp; In answer to this charge it has been said,
that, though nearly two hundred offences of almost as many
degrees of guilt, are made equally punishable with death; yet
justice is administered with so much <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>discretion and mercy, that the
penalty is inflicted only on a few.&nbsp; Feeble as this excuse
is, for a law that deals in blood, it would be well for the law
of Honour if it admitted of such a palliation.&nbsp; But the
truth is, that in the latter case there is nothing to abate the
demand for blood&mdash;the prosecution of every difference is
both summary and vindictive: there is no tribunal to enquire into
the original matter of the quarrel; no judicature to determine
the real merits of the controversy: if the judgment be erroneous,
there is no court of equity to reverse the verdict; if rigorous,
there is no arm of mercy to withdraw the victim from
suffering.</p>
<p>It must be evident from this view which has been presented of
the law, that, as an <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>injury may be created by the most
trivial incident, so punishment may be inflicted with the most
preposterous and unequal retribution.&nbsp; I cannot better
illustrate the frivolous foundation upon which an injury may be
erected, than by adverting to an occurrence of very recent date,
and of sufficient notoriety in the Fashionable World.&nbsp; Two
men of Fashion, incensed against each other by an accidental
quarrel between their respective dogs, dropped, in their warmth,
certain expressions which rendered them amenable to the bloody
code: duel was declared indispensable: and in less than twelve
hours, one of the two was dispatched into eternity, and the other
narrowly escaped the same fate. <a name="citation42"></a><a
href="#footnote42" class="citation">[42]</a></p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>The
inequality of the retribution is, indeed, an inevitable
consequence of that article of the code which compels men of
Fashion, without distinction, to decide their differences by
fighting a duel.&nbsp; It results from this promiscuous
injunction, that the peaceable man must fight the quarrelsome;
that the heir of a noble family must meet <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the ruined
esquire; and that the man who has never drawn a trigger in his
life, must encounter the Fashionable ruffian, who has all his
life been doing little else.&nbsp; This inequality is further
manifest, from the different circumstances and connexions of life
under which the combatants may be found.&nbsp; The son of many
hopes may be matched against the worthless prodigal; the virtuous
parent against the unprincipled seducer; and the man of industry,
usefulness, and beneficence, against the miscreant who only lives
to pamper his lusts, and to corrupt his fellow-creatures.&nbsp;
Nothing has here been said of the indiscriminate manner in which
judgment is executed.&nbsp; The innocent and the guilty must both
be involved in the same awful contingency; each <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>must put his
life to hazard: and the probability is, that, if one of the two
should fall, it will be the man whose conduct least entitled him
to punishment, and whose life was most worth preserving.</p>
<p>I forbear to enter further into the system of Fashionable
government, or to meddle with the inferior points of
legislation.&nbsp; What has been said of the Law of Honour, will
apply, with little variation, to every other institution of minor
concern.&nbsp; To facilitate polite intercourse, and to exclude,
as much as may be, duties to God and inferiors, is a considerable
object in every regulation; and it is but justice to this people
to say, that, in this respect, they are at once consistent and
successful.</p>
<h2><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>CHAP.
III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">RELIGION AND
MORALITY.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> attempting to give an account of
the <i>Religion</i> of the people of Fashion, I feel myself not a
little embarrassed.&nbsp; It were, indeed, very much to be
wished, that one of their own number would, in the name of the
rest, draw up a confession of their faith.&nbsp; This is,
perhaps, expecting too much; and yet I cannot but think that it
would be a very good employment for some of those modish priests,
who pass so much of their time in the circles of Fashion.&nbsp;
They give every proof that they have leisure for the <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>undertaking:
and the access which they have to these people, by attending them
so familiarly at their theatres, their operas, and their routs,
must render them perfectly masters of the subject.&nbsp; However,
as I am not aware that any thing of this nature is yet taken in
hand, I shall lay before my reader such observations as I have
been able to make; partly because it seems necessary to the
perfection of my work, that something should be said on the
subject, and partly because I should be unwilling to afford by my
silence any ground for suspicion&mdash;that there is <i>no</i>
religion in the Fashionable World.</p>
<p>I am, then, in the first place, decidedly of opinion, that
people of Fashion are not <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span><i>Atheists</i>; though I am
sufficiently aware, that some strict religionists have
entertained an opposite conviction.&nbsp; It has been contended
by the latter, in support of their hypothesis, that people who
believed in a God would have some scruple about taking such
liberties with his name, and his attributes, and his
threatenings, and, generally, with all his moral prerogatives, as
people of Fashion are accustomed to do.&nbsp; There is certainly
something plausible in this sort of reasoning, and I must
candidly confess, that I have never yet seen it fairly
overthrown; but then I cannot think, that it proves their
disbelief of a God, though it certainly does prove their want of
reverence for him.&nbsp; It seems to me, at the same time,
probable, that the ideas of this people, and <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>those of
stricter Christians, upon the subject of that reverence which is
due to the Deity, may differ sufficiently, to account for these
offensive liberties, without having recourse to the hypothesis of
atheism.&nbsp; Indeed, when I consider the spirit and
construction of that law by which these people are bound, I can
find other reasons for their conduct in this respect, besides
that which these theorists have assigned.&nbsp; For, to say the
truth, those obnoxious expressions from which so much has been
inferred, are in perfect unison with the exclusion of a Deity
from the rules which regulate their intercourse with each
other.&nbsp; The more therefore I reflect on this subject, the
more I am confirmed in my opinion, that the charge of Atheism
against them is without <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>any just foundation; and that their
appeals to God in levity, earnestness, and anger, are designed to
shew their contempt of His authority, and not their denial of his
being.</p>
<p>I was for a long time of opinion, that these people were
believers in <i>Christ</i>; for I had observed, that his name was
found in their formularies of devotion, associated with their
baptismal designation, and frequently appealed to in their
conversation with each other.&nbsp; There were, I confess, many
things at the time which staggered me.&nbsp; Having taken up my
ideas of the Saviour from those Scriptures which they profess to
receive as well as myself, I was not a little astonished at the
ultimate difference <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>between us.&nbsp; Their belief of a God was, I knew,
inevitable, and forced upon them by every thing in nature and
experience; I could therefore conceive, without much difficulty,
how they could subscribe to his being, and yet not hallow his
name; but I could not with equal facility conceive, that people
should go out of their way to embrace a solemn article of
revealed religion, only that they might have an opportunity of
trifling with the holy name of Him, who was the author and the
object of that revelation.</p>
<p>I had, besides, occasion to remark, that this name was seldom
appealed to, but by the ladies; and it did not appear in the
first instance probable, that the gentlemen would <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>leave them in
exclusive possession of a mode of imprecation by which any thing
was meant.&nbsp; These and other circumstances excited in my mind
a great deal of speculation.&nbsp; I will not, however, trouble
my readers with the many conclusions which I drew from them;
since an event has occurred, which affords no indifferent
evidence, that belief in a Saviour does <i>not</i> form an
article of Fashionable religion.&nbsp; The event to which I
refer, is the publication of a Memoir of the late Lord
Camelford.&nbsp; In this Memoir the author professes to acquaint
the world with the last moments of a Fashionable young man who
had received a mortal wound in an affair of honour.&nbsp; In
perusing this extraordinary narrative, I was much surprised at
finding, that neither <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the dying penitent (for such he is
represented to have been) nor his spiritual confessor ever once
mentioned the name of <i>Christ</i>.&nbsp; But when, on further
attention, I found his Lordship expressing a hope, that his
<i>own</i> dying sufferings would expiate his sins, and placing
his dependance upon the mercy of his <i>Creator</i>; <a
name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a> I had only to conclude, that the Divine
was deterred from <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>mentioning a name with which his office must have made
him familiar, out of respect for that Fashionable creed from
which it is excluded.</p>
<p>There is some reason for supposing that these people believe
in the immortality of the soul, the existence of an evil spirit,
and a place of future torment.&nbsp; It must, at the same time,
be acknowledged, that their ideas on each of these points are so
loose and confused, that it is difficult to determine in what
sense they apprehend them.</p>
<p>In subscribing, for example, to the immortality of the soul,
they give it a value which infinitely exceeds that of the
corruptible <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>body: the inference from this, in a fair train of
reasoning, would be, that the care of the former is of infinitely
more importance than that of the latter.&nbsp; And yet this is
manifestly not the inference they draw: for the experience of
every week proves, that if they give three hours to the soul,
they think it too much; while they will give six days and nights
to the body, and think it too little.&nbsp; This is, I confess, a
part of their character, of which no satisfactory explanation has
ever been given.</p>
<p>I have no other evidence of their belief in an evil Spirit,
and a place of future Torment, than the report of their
Prayer-books, and the tenor of their conversation.&nbsp; I must,
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>at the
same time, acknowledge, that the looseness and frequency with
which they refer to Hell and the Devil, on the most ordinary
occasions, have excited my doubts whether they use these awful
terms in the same religious sense in which orthodox Christians
are accustomed to employ them.&nbsp; These doubts have been
greatly encouraged by that sceptical facetiousness with which
they apply the name of the evil spirit to their Fashionable
amusements, and make the place of torment a subject of scenic
representation.&nbsp; I will not say that these people do not
believe what they thus caricature; but I think it must be obvious
that they cannot have any very exact notions of their scriptural
import, while they continue to <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>employ them as terms of merriment,
and sources of diversion. <a name="citation57"></a><a
href="#footnote57" class="citation">[57]</a></p>
<p>Religious worship, though not inculcated as absolutely
necessary in the Fashionable World, is yet neither prohibited nor
renounced.&nbsp; Certain persons of considerable influence among
them, and whose connexion with them arose out of the incidental
circumstances of birth, or office, or elevation, have carried
into the societies of Fashion some principles which operate as a
check upon the natural libertinism of the community.&nbsp; I
impute it to this circumstance, rather than to any sober
consideration <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>of duty, that religious worship, though it is not
esteemed <i>essential</i> to a Fashionable character, is yet not
regarded as any impeachment of it.&nbsp; My reason, in a word,
for ascribing their conformity in this particular to influence
rather than principle, is the difficulty of reconciling it, on
any hypothesis besides, to the other parts of their
conduct.&nbsp; For it would be a contradiction of ideas to
suppose, that persons can seriously mean to worship a God whom
they habitually blaspheme; or to pray against a devil, whom they
are accustomed to hold out as a bugbear or a joke.</p>
<p>Their mode of worship is generally that which prevails in the
country in which they live: they like the credit of an
Establishment, <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>and the convenience of taking things as they find
them.&nbsp; There are, I am told, some members of Fashion among
those who dissent from the established religion.&nbsp; These I
shall leave to the care of their Pastors; and proceed to
animadvert upon the Fashionable adherents to the religion of the
State.</p>
<p>In their manner of observing the rites of public worship,
nothing is so remarkable as the degree of refinement they
contrive to introduce into every part of it which is capable of
being refined upon.&nbsp; Chapels are, for the most part,
preferred to Churches; and the reason, among others, for this
preference, appears to be, that the modernness of their
structure, and their exemption from <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>parochial controul, render them
better adapted to such elegant improvements as are requisite for
Fashionable piety.&nbsp; Hence that variety of ingenious
accommodations, and fanciful ornaments, which gives to their
favourite place of devotion the air of a drawing-room: so that a
stranger, introduced to their religious assemblies, might be
excused for doubting, whether he was about to worship the Deity,
or to pay a Fashionable visit.&nbsp; The conduct of their service
is, in many cases, marked by an attention to mechanical effect,
which is more nearly allied to the parade of the theatre, than to
the simplicity of the church.&nbsp; The orators who fill their
pulpits, are generally preferred in proportion as they display
the captivating attractions of a graceful exterior, <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>and a liberal
theology.&nbsp; These preachers have, indeed, a task to execute
of no ordinary difficulty.&nbsp; By the tyranny of custom they
are compelled to take their text, and to produce their
authorities, from the canon of Scripture; and I think it is much
to the praise of their dexterity, that so often as they have
occasion to discourse from those offensive writings, they yet
contrive to give so little offence.&nbsp; How they manage this, I
am at a loss to know; unless it be by blinking every question
that involves a moral application; or else by allowing their
audience the benefit of that Fashionable salvo, that the company
present is always excepted.</p>
<p>It has also been remarked by scrupulous <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>observers,
that this people perform almost the whole of their public
devotions in a posture which rather accommodates their indolence,
than expresses their respect for the object of their
worship.&nbsp; If this be the fact, it is not a little
extraordinary; since they use a liturgy which prescribes
<i>kneeling</i> and <i>standing</i>, as well as <i>sitting</i>;
and which contains distinct instructions, when each is to be
used.&nbsp; I can, indeed, account, without much difficulty, for
the disuse of <i>kneeling</i>; because the structure of the pews
does not always admit of it: besides that, it is a posture into
which people cannot be expected readily to fall in public, who
have not much practice in private.&nbsp; But I cannot so easily
account for their refusing to <i>stand</i>: for this is
notoriously an attitude to which <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>they are sufficiently
accustomed.&nbsp; And that they do not consider the posture in
which a thing is done, indifferent, is manifest from the zeal
with which they rise from their seats, and expect others to do
the same, when about to join in a loyal chorus.&nbsp; I wonder it
has not occurred to them, that there is some indecency, not to
say impiety, in <i>rising</i> from their seats to sing the
praises of their King, and <i>keeping</i> them while they sing
the praises of their <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>I have before delivered it as my opinion, that this people
comply with the custom of public worship, rather from influence
than from conviction; and this opinion receives some confirmation
from the pains <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>they take to remove those impressions which the offices
of religion may have made upon their minds.&nbsp; In the
metropolis, the visit to the house of God is succeeded, as soon
as may be, by the drive into the Park.&nbsp; Here they meet with
a prodigious concourse of persons of their own description; and
have the most charming opportunities of seeing the world,
exhibiting themselves, and conversing upon the opera of the
preceding evening, or the parties for the ensuing week.&nbsp; The
effect of this drive, upon their animal spirits and the whole
frame of their mind, is just what might have been expected.&nbsp;
Though they have so recently assisted at the most awful
solemnities, they can now relax into the most idle levity or the
most boisterous mirth; and satisfying themselves <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>that they
have done their duty, by remembering the Almighty in the first
part of the day, they take no common pains to forget him during
the remainder.</p>
<p>In the vicinity of the metropolis, and in other places of
Fashionable residence, other expedients are resorted to, in order
to produce the same happy effect.&nbsp; No sooner has the priest
pronounced his <i>Morning</i> benediction, than the carriage
which has conveyed the family to church must be driven round the
neighbourhood; and the bells and knockers of twenty doors
announce, that the restraints of public worship are at an
end.&nbsp; This pleasant divertisement is not lost upon the great
body of the inhabitants.&nbsp; Persons the farthest removed <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>from all
Fashionable pretensions, rejoice with their superiors at this
speedy termination of the Sabbath; and, with a servile imitation
of <i>their</i> example, pursue their pleasures in some house of
entertainment, instead of seeking a <i>second</i> blessing in the
house of God. <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a></p>
<p>Though there is something very lively and ingenious in this
method of dissipating religious impressions, yet I think it might
be an improvement upon the plan, not to allow them to be made at
all.&nbsp; Experiments to this effect have been actually tried <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>by some
persons of no mean condition, in the Fashionable World, who have
wholly renounced the habit of public worship; and these
experiments would probably have been tried upon a much larger
scale, had it not been for the consideration of setting a
pernicious example: for it seems to be a maxim among many of
them, that persons in a dependent state <i>may</i> really be
benefited by the offices of devotion.&nbsp; With a charity,
therefore, that does them honour, they make a sacrifice of their
feelings and their time to the interests of their inferiors; and
when it is considered, how much whirling in a carriage, gaping,
gadding, and gossiping, it takes them, to recover the true tone
of dissipation, it will be seen that the sacrifice is not
inconsiderable.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>In
observing thus largely upon the religion of the Fashionable
World, I have furnished a sufficient clue to their <i>moral</i>
character.&nbsp; If, from some hints which have been thrown out
in this and the preceding chapter, rigid Christians should be led
to infer, that it is no better than it should be, they must be
reminded, that people of Fashion have a standard peculiar to
themselves; and that, therefore, what are deviations from
<i>our</i> standard, are very often near approximations to
<i>theirs</i>.&nbsp; In fact, they have acted in this respect
with the same convenient policy by which they have been guided in
framing every other part of their system.&nbsp; Pleasure being
the object upon which a life of Fashion terminates, it was
sagaciously enough foreseen, <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>that an unbending morality would be
utterly incompatible with the modes, and habits, and plans, of
such a career.&nbsp; There remained therefore no alternative, but
that of frittering away the strength and substance of the
morality of the Gospel, till it became sufficiently tame and
pliable for the sphere of accommodation in which it was to
act.&nbsp; The consequence has been, that while they employ the
same terms to denote their moral ideas, as are in use among
Christians in general, yet they limit, or enlarge, their
signification, as expediency requires.&nbsp; Thus modesty,
honesty, humanity, and sobriety&mdash;names, with stricter
moralists, for the purest virtues&mdash;are so modified and
liberalized by Fashionable casuists, as to be capable of an
alliance <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>with a low degree of every vice to which they stand
opposed.&nbsp; A woman may expose her bosom, paint her face,
assume a forward air, gaze without emotion, and laugh without
restraint, at the loosest scenes of theatrical licentiousness;
and yet be, after all,&mdash;a <i>modest</i> woman.&nbsp; A man
may detain the money which he owes his tradesman, and contract
new debts for ostentatious superfluities, while he has neither
the means nor the inclination to pay his old ones; and yet be,
after all,&mdash;a very <i>honest</i> fellow.&nbsp; A woman of
Fashion may disturb the repose of her family every night, abandon
her children to mercenary nurses, and keep her horses and her
servants in the streets till day-break,&mdash;without any
impeachment of her <i>humanity</i>.&nbsp; So the gentleman of
Fashion <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>may swallow his two or three bottles a-day, and do all
his friends the kindness to lay them under the table as often as
they dine with him; yet, if constitution or habit secure him
against the same ignominious effects, he claims to be
considered&mdash;a <i>sober</i> man.</p>
<p>There would be no end of going over all the eccentricities of
Fashionable morality.&nbsp; To those who exact that truth which
allows of no duplicity, that honour which scorns all baseness,
and that virtue which wars with every vice, I question but every
thing in the morals of this people would appear anomalous and
extraordinary: but to those who consider, how necessary a certain
portion of wickedness is to such a life of sense <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>as these
people must necessarily lead, it will not be matter of surprise
that there should be so little genuine morality among them; the
wonder will rather be&mdash;that there should be any at all.</p>
<h2><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>CHAP.
IV</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">EDUCATION.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> people in the universe expend
larger sums upon the education of their children than people of
Fashion.&nbsp; It is a maxim with them to commence the great
business of instruction in the very earliest period of life; and
if the system of education corresponded with the pains bestowed
upon it, and the price at which it is purchased, no persons would
do more honour to society than the subjects of the Fashionable
World.&nbsp; As it is, they are not a little ornamental to a
nation.&nbsp; They are not, it is <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>true, either the columns or the base
of the building; they neither support nor strengthen it: but they
supply the place of reliefs, and hangings, and other superadded
decorations.</p>
<p>Religion is allowed a respectable place among the studies of
the nursery.&nbsp; All those useful tables of instruction are
assiduously employed, which teach, who was the <i>first</i>, the
<i>wisest</i>, the <i>meekest</i>, and the <i>strongest</i> man;
and the nursling is carefully conducted, by a catechetical
process, into the theory and practice of a Christian.&nbsp; As,
however, the child advances to boyish or girlish years, this
religious discipline is pretty generally relaxed, in order to
allow sufficient scope for the cultivation of those <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>modish
pursuits, which mark the man and the woman of Fashion.</p>
<p>And here I cannot help remarking, how anxious the greater part
of Fashionable parents are, to guard the minds of their children
against the <i>permanent</i> influence of that religion, which
they yet have caused them to be taught.&nbsp; The fact is, that
they would have them acquainted with the technical language, and
expert in the liturgical formalities of Christianity; for these
acquirements can neither disparage their character, nor impede
their pleasures: but a serious impression of its truths upon
their hearts, might disaffect them to the follies and vices which
they are destined to practise; and therefore is the thing, of all
<a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>others,
that is most to be dreaded.&nbsp; The parents are, to say the
truth, not a little hampered by the engagements under which they
have bound the child, on the one part; and the character which
they wish him to sustain, on the other.&nbsp; To leave him in
ignorance of a covenant in which he has been involuntarily
included, would be a fraud upon his conscience; and yet, to have
him renounce the devil, the world, and the flesh, would be the
utter ruin of his Fashionable reputation.&nbsp; What other
course, then, can parents thus circumstanced pursue, than that of
inculcating these lessons before they can be understood, and
removing their impression before they can be practised?</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>It is,
I presume, upon the principle of precaution already mentioned,
that our Fashionable young men are not always intrusted to the
care of persons distinguished for the practice of piety.&nbsp; It
is not impossible, indeed, that, either from the conversation,
the connexions, or the example of the preceptor, the pupil may
contract certain habits, which it was not the precise object of
his education to produce.&nbsp; But then the evil is not so great
as fastidious moralists would insinuate.&nbsp; For, as the youth
is to figure in the circles of Fashion, he will only have learnt,
a little before the time, those practices which are to form a
part of his manly character: and though it might, perhaps, be as
well, if he did not learn to swear and rake quite so soon; yet <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>it is some
consolation, that he has escaped those methodistical impressions,
which would have prevented him from swearing and raking as long
as he lived.</p>
<p>It may also be considered as some confirmation of the
reasoning above employed, that parents introduce their children
as early as possible to the amusements of the theatre.&nbsp; Now,
though swearing, and raking, and gaming, when carried to excess,
are blamed even by persons of Fashion themselves; yet it is
notorious, that a reasonable proportion of each is indispensably
requisite to a popular character in the circles of
refinement.&nbsp; Habits of this sort must not be precipitately
taken up.&nbsp; There must be a schooling for the man of
pleasure, as <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>well as for the man of letters: and certainly no school
exists, in which the elements of modish vice can be studied with
greater promise of proficiency, than the public theatres.&nbsp;
When it is considered, at what pains the managers of the stage
are, to import the seducing dramas of Germany, as well as to get
up the loose productions of the English Muse; when it is further
considered, how studious the actors and actresses are to do
justice, and even more than justice, to the luscious scenes of
the piece; to give effect to the equivoques, by an arch emphasis;
and to the oaths, by a dauntless intonation:&mdash;when to all
this is added, how many painted strumpets are stuck about the
theatre, in the boxes, the galleries, and the avenues; and how
many challenges to <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>prostitution are thrown out in every direction: it will,
I think, be difficult to imagine places better adapted, than the
theatres at this moment are, to teach the theory and practice of
Fashionable iniquity.</p>
<p>What has been observed on the subject of education, though
said principally with reference to the male branches of
Fashionable families, will yet, with a few changes, be found
applicable to the youth of the other sex.&nbsp; The principal
points upon which their scheme of education is brought to bear,
are those of dissipation and display.&nbsp; A brilliant finger on
the piano, wanton flexions in the dance, a rage for operas,
plays, and parties, and the faculty of undergoing the fatiguing
evolutions <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>of a Fashionable life, without compunction of
conscience, sense of weariness, or indications of disgust, are
qualifications which she who has acquired, will be considered as
wanting little of a perfect education.</p>
<p>The same assiduity is discovered on the part of the parents,
to train their girls for the sphere of polite life, as has been
already observed with respect to the boys; and the methods that
are pursued to accomplish this end, are very nearly the
same.&nbsp; The blush of virgin-modesty (it is naturally
foreseen) would be extremely inconvenient, not to say absolutely
indecorous, in a woman of Fashion; and therefore it is wisely
resolved, that such steps shall be taken upon <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>the
girl&rsquo;s growing into life, as may most effectually destroy
it.&nbsp; The theatre seems principally to be resorted to for
this purpose; and it must be manifest, from what has been already
advanced, that no expedient could have been better chosen.&nbsp;
As intrigue is the life of the drama, and this cannot be carried
on, without expressions, attitudes, and communications between
the sexes, of a very particular nature, there is every reason for
regarding the stage as a sovereign remedy for the infirmity of
<i>blushing</i>.</p>
<p>There are other things to be said on behalf of the theatre, as
a school of polite morality.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>It has
already appeared, that the system of Ethics which prevails among
people of Fashion, differs materially from the received system of
unfashionable Christians.&nbsp; Now, I know not any means by
which a stranger, anxious to ascertain, wherein that difference
consists, could better satisfy his enquiries, than by visiting
the theatres.&nbsp; The doctrine of the stage, therefore,
exhibiting (as nearly as possible) the standard morality of
polite society, nothing could be better imagined, than to give
the embryo woman of Fashion the earliest opportunity of learning
to so much advantage, those lessons which she is afterwards to
practise through life.&nbsp; What she has imbibed in the nursery,
and what she hears in the church, would inspire her with a
dread&mdash;perhaps a dislike&mdash;of many <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>things upon
which she must learn hereafter to look with familiar
indifference, if not with absolute complacency.&nbsp; She might
thus (if some remedy were not provided) be led to take up with
certain melancholy principles, which would either shut her out
from the society of her friends, or make her miserable among
them.&nbsp; But the stage corrects all this; and more than
counterbalances the impressions of virtue, by stratagems of the
happiest contrivance.</p>
<p>It is worthy of attention, how much ingenuity is displayed in
bringing about that moral temperament, which is necessary for the
meridian of Fashion.&nbsp; The rake, who is debauching innocence,
squandering away <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>property, and extending the influence of licentiousness
to the utmost of his power, would (if fairly represented) excite
spontaneous and universal abhorrence.&nbsp; But this result would
be extremely inconvenient; since raking, seduction, and
prodigality, make half the business, and almost all the
reputation, of men of Fashion.&nbsp; What, then, must be
done?&mdash;Some qualities of acknowledged excellence must be
associated with these vicious propensities, in order to prevent
them from occasioning unmingled disgust.&nbsp; We may, I presume,
refer it to the same policy, that in dramas of the greatest
popularity, the worthless libertine is represented as having at
the bottom some of those properties which reflect most honour
upon human nature; <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>while&mdash;as if to throw the balance still more in
favour of vice&mdash;the man of professed virtue is delineated as
being in the main a sneaking and hypocritical villain.&nbsp;
Lessons such as these are not likely to be lost upon the
ingenuous feelings of a young girl.&nbsp; For, besides the
fascinations of an elegant address and an artful manner, the
whole conduct of the plot is an insidious appeal to the
simplicity of her heart.&nbsp; She is taught to believe, by these
representations, that profligacy is the exuberance of a generous
nature, and decorum the veil of a bad heart: so that having
learnt, in the outset of her career, to associate frankness with
vice, and duplicity with virtue, she will not be likely to
separate these <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>combinations during the remainder of her life.</p>
<p>To enter further into the minute details of a Fashionable
education, would only be to travel over ground which has been
often and ingeniously explored by writers of the greatest
eminence.&nbsp; Enough has been said to show, that the system of
education adopted by this people, like every other branch of
their economy, is adapted to qualify the parties for that polite
intercourse with each other, which seems to constitute the very
end of their being.&nbsp; And if it be considered, of what nature
that intercourse is, it will occasion no surprise, that the
education which prepares for it should be expressly adapted <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>to confound
the distinctions of virtue and vice; and to inculcate, with that
view,&mdash;duplicity in religion, and prevarication in
morals.</p>
<h2><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>CHAP.
V.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span
class="GutSmall">MANNERS&mdash;LANGUAGE.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Manners</i> of this people
are remarkably artificial.&nbsp; They appear to do every thing by
rule; and not a word, a look, or a movement escapes them, but
what has at one time or other been studied.&nbsp; In every part
of their demeanour they have reference to some invisible
standard, which they call the <i>Ton</i>, or the Fashion, (from
which latter term they have derived their appellation;) and by
this mysterious talisman their manners, their dress, their
language, and the <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>whole of their behaviour, are tried.&nbsp; It is
singular enough, that this standard which is to fix every thing,
is itself the most variable of all things.&nbsp; The changes
which it undergoes are so rapid, that it requires a sort of
telegraphic communication to become acquainted with them: and
though there is no regular way by which they may be known, yet
nothing is considered so disgraceful as not to know them.</p>
<p>The fluctuations to which this standard is subject, render it
difficult to catch the features of people of Fashion, or to speak
with any precision upon the exterior of their character.&nbsp;
They are, in fact, moulded and modified by such capricious and
indefinable circumstances, that he who would <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>exhibit a
true picture of their manners, must write a history of the
endless transmutations through which they are compelled to
pass.&nbsp; It has, indeed, been remarked by nice observers, that
a dissimulation of their sentiments and their feelings, is a
feature in the character of this people, which never forsakes
them; and that amidst all the revolutions which their other
habits experience, this master-principle preserves an unchanging
uniformity.&nbsp; Nor is it sufficient to overthrow this
reasoning, that, among the innovations of recent times, the
manners of people of Fashion have been brought into an affected
resemblance to those of their inferiors.&nbsp; The cropped head,
and groomish dress of the men, and the noisy tone and vulgar air
of the women, would almost persuade <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>a stranger that these are blunt and
artless people, and that they love nothing so much as honesty and
plain-dealing.&nbsp; The fact, however, is, that though the mode
of playing is varied, yet the game of dissimulation is still
going on.&nbsp; This condescension to vulgarity is, after all,
the disguise of pride, and not the dress of simplicity; and is as
remote from the sincerity which it imitates, as from the
refinement which it renounces.</p>
<p>An exaggerated opinion of their own importance is, in reality,
a prevailing characteristic of the Fashionable World.</p>
<p>The Greeks and Romans were thought to have gone too far, when
they called all <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>nations but their own <i>barbarians</i>; but people of
Fashion go a step farther: for they consider themselves <i>every
body</i>, and the rest of the world <i>nobody</i>.&nbsp; The
influence of this sentiment is sufficiently discernible over the
whole of their character.&nbsp; It dictates to their affections,
and robs them, in many instances, of their spontaneity, their
sweetness, and their force.&nbsp; It results from this conceit,
that their love is often artificial, their friendship
ceremonious, and their charity ungracious.&nbsp; In a word, the
whole of their demeanour is such as might be expected from a
people, who idolize the most frivolous or the most vicious
propensities of human nature; and estimate as <i>nothing</i>, the
talents, and industry, and virtue, which adorn it.</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Their
<i>Language</i> would afford great scope for discussion; but the
limits which I have prescribed to my work, will not allow me to
embrace it.&nbsp; I shall, however, throw together such remarks
as may enable the reader to form some judgment of it; and refer
him, for more extended information upon it, to those modish
compositions in which it is conveyed, and to the circles in which
it is spoken.</p>
<p>Their <i>language</i>, then, is generally a dialect of the
people among whom they reside.&nbsp; They do, it is true,
intersperse their conversational dialogue with scraps of French
and Italian; they also construct their complimentary phrases with
singular dexterity; they have, besides, certain epithets; <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>such as
<i>dashing</i>, <i>stylish</i>, &amp;c. which may be considered
as perfectly their own:&mdash;but if these be excepted, the rest
of their language is, to the best of my judgment, wholly
vernacular.</p>
<p>It must not, however, be supposed, that because these people
use the terms of the country in which they live, they therefore
use them in their ordinary and received acceptation.&nbsp;
Nothing can be farther from the fact.&nbsp; I verily believe,
that if the whole nomenclature of Fashion were examined from
beginning to end, scarcely twenty words would be found, which in
passing over to the regions of Fashion, have not left their
native and customary sense behind them.</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>In
support of this observation I shall cite, for the reader&rsquo;s
satisfaction, a brief extract from a private memorandum, which I
had originally made with a design of constructing a Fashionable
glossary.</p>

<p>I am far from pretending to have assigned the precise
significations in which the words above cited are employed by
people of Fashion.&nbsp; Perhaps I have done as much towards
fixing the sense, as will be expected of one who cannot pretend
to be perfectly in their confidence.&nbsp; In fact, the
transmutation of terms is an operation to which this people are
most devoutly addicted.&nbsp; It is <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>daily making some advances among
them; and keeps pace with the progress of their ideas, from the
correct and authentic notions of truth and virtue, to those loose
and spurious ones by which they are superseded.</p>
<p>In proof of this statement, I need only adduce those phrases
in which they are accustomed to pronounce the eulogium of their
deceased associates.</p>
<p>For example,&mdash;Is reference made to an unthinking
profligate who has lately been hurried from the world?&nbsp; His
vices are glanced at, and cursorily condemned: but still it is
affirmed, that, with all his faults, he always <i>meant well</i>;
he had <i>a good heart </i><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span><i>at the bottom</i>; and he was
<i>nobody&rsquo;s enemy but his own</i>.</p>
<p>And for whom is this apology offered, and this praise
indirectly solicited?&nbsp; For the man who, if he ever meant any
thing, meant nothing more or better, than to gratify his lusts,
pursue his vicious pleasures, drink his wine, shake his dice,
shuffle his cards; and thus waste his existence, and destroy his
soul.&nbsp; Of such a man it is gravely affirmed,
that&mdash;<i>he always meant well</i>.</p>
<p>And of whom is it said, that he had <i>a good
heart</i>?&mdash;Of the man who rarely manifested, through the
whole of his life, any other symptoms than those which <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>indicate a
bad one.&nbsp; His mouth was full of cursing and bitterness; his
humour was choleric and revengeful; his feet moved swift to shed
blood; there was no conscience in his bosom, and no fear of God
before his eyes; and yet, because he was occasionally charitable,
and habitually convivial, no doubt is entertained but
that&mdash;<i>he had a good heart at the bottom</i>.</p>
<p>Lastly, <i>he</i> is said to have been <i>nobody&rsquo;s enemy
but his own</i>, who has wasted the earnings of an industrious
ancestor, and bequeathed beggary and shame to his innocent
descendants.&nbsp; The wretch has distressed his family by his
prodigality, and corrupted thousands by his example; and yet,
because he has been the dupe of his lusts, <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>and fallen
a martyr to his vices, he is pronounced to have
been&mdash;<i>nobody&rsquo;s enemy but his own</i>.</p>
<p>These instances will serve to throw some light upon the sort
of idiom employed by people of Fashion; and the manner in which
they have wrested expressions of no little importance, from their
natural and legitimate signification.</p>
<p>But before I quit the consideration of their <i>language</i>,
I think it my duty to point out another peculiarity; of which, to
the best of my knowledge, no satisfactory account has yet been
given.&nbsp; Whether it arise from the paucity of their words,
the confusion of their ideas, or any other cause <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>distinct
from each of these, so it is, that they have but <i>one</i> term
by which they are accustomed to express their strong emotions
both of pleasure and pain.&nbsp; On this <i>term</i> you will
find them ringing perpetual changes; and, strange to say, it is
to be heard, under one or other of its grammatical inflections,
<a name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a> in almost every sentence which falls
from their lips.&nbsp; The master has recourse to it in scolding
his servants, the officer in reprimanding his men.&nbsp; The <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>traveller
employs it in recounting his adventures, and the man of pleasure
in describing his intrigues.&nbsp; It is heard in the house, and
in the field; in moments of seriousness, and of levity; in
expressions of praise, and of blame.&nbsp; In short, it is used
on occasions the most dissimilar, under impressions the most
contradictory, and for purposes the most opposite; and is, in
fact, the <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> of every energetic and
emphatical period.</p>
<p>Now it happens, unfortunately, that this <i>catholicon</i> in
Fashionable phraseology is, of all terms, that to which sober
Christians annex the most awful ideas; and from the use of which
they as scrupulously abstain, as they do from that of the Great
Being <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>whose vengeance it so tremendously expresses.&nbsp; And
it may be worthy of consideration, whether this familiar and
unfeeling employment, by people of Fashion, of a term which
imports <i>infernal punishment</i>, does not strengthen those
doubts which have been already suggested, of their real belief in
a place of future torment.</p>
<p>It ought not at the same time to be overlooked, that, in this
respect, they bear a close resemblance to the vulgarest part of
the community; and it would furnish a subject of curious
investigation, why two classes in society, respectively the
highest and the lowest, should exhibit so striking an agreement
in a material branch of language.&nbsp; <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>I know it
has been said, that extremes meet; and the fact before us is so
much proof that the remark is just: but that by no means solves
the difficulty.&nbsp; For, after all, the question returns upon
us, <i>why</i> such a fact should exist?&nbsp; I confess, for my
own part, I know no answer that can be given to it; and I very
much wish that some one of their number would undertake to
explain their real motives for courting a resemblance in
<i>one</i> respect with that description of society, from which
they make it their pride to differ in every <i>other</i>.</p>

108</span>CHAP. VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span
class="GutSmall">DRESS&mdash;AMUSEMENTS.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are, in the <i>Dress</i> of
this people, many singularities, upon which, he who wished to say
every thing that could be said, might say a great deal.&nbsp; The
peculiarity which a stranger would be most apt to remark, is that
of their striving to be as unlike as possible to the rest of the
world.&nbsp; This appears, indeed, to be the parent of almost
every other peculiarity; and certainly gives birth to many
changes not a little ridiculous and prejudicial.</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>It
being a sort of fundamental maxim with them, that superiority
consists in dissimilitude, they become engaged in a perpetual
competition with the world at large, and to a certain degree with
each other.&nbsp; In order to maintain this struggle for
pre-eminence, they are compelled to vary the modes and materials
of their dress in all the ways which a fanciful imagination can
suggest.&nbsp; It happens, through some strange infatuation, that
those who affect to despise the man or woman of Fashion, yet ape
their dress and air with the most impertinent and vexatious
perseverance.&nbsp; What is to be done in this
case?&mdash;Similitude is not to be endured.&nbsp; In order
therefore to throw out their pursuers, these monopolizers of the
mode are compelled to run into such eccentricities, <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>as nothing
could justify or palliate, but the distress to which they are
reduced.&nbsp; If, for example, short skirts and low capes are
copied by the herd of imitators, the Fashionables seek their
remedy in the opposite extreme; their skirts are drawn down to
the calves of their legs, and their capes pulled over their ears
with as much solemnity and dispatch, as if their existence
depended upon the measure.&nbsp; So if full petticoats and high
kerchiefs are adopted by the misses of the crowd, the
dressing-chambers of Fashion are all bustle and
confusion:&mdash;the limbs are stripped, and the bosom laid bare,
though the east wind may be blowing at the time; and coughs,
rheumatisms, and consumptions, be upon the wings of every
blast.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>This
rage for dissimilitude in the affairs of the <i>wardrobe</i>, is
allowed an indefinite scope.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as far as I can
learn, there are no determinate points, beyond which it would be
esteemed indecent or imprudent to indulge it.&nbsp; The
consequence is, that the <i>groom</i> and the <i>gentleman</i>
may be often mistaken for each other; and he who is recognised
to-day as a <i>man of Fashion</i>, may to-morrow be confounded
with <i>one of the people</i>.</p>
<p>I confess I have always regarded this part of their conduct as
an impeachment of their political wisdom.&nbsp; I should have
thought <i>&agrave; priori</i>, that a people who are so jealous
of their pre-eminence in society, would not have overlooked the
degree in <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>which dress contributes to uphold it.&nbsp; Many a
Fashionable man must depend for the whole of his estimation, upon
the cut of his coat, and the selection of his wardrobe.&nbsp; A
frivolous or preposterous taste may therefore prove fatal to the
only sort of reputation which it was in his power to
obtain.&nbsp; But besides, an interchange of dress between people
of Fashion and those whom they consider their inferiors, may
eventually produce very serious mischiefs.&nbsp; The distinctions
of rank and condition are manifestly matters of external
regulation, and consequently cannot be kept up without a due
attention to external appearances.&nbsp; He therefore who makes
himself vulgar or ridiculous, is guilty of an act of
self-degradation; and the fault will be his own, if he is <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>displaced
or despised; since he has renounced that appropriate costume,
which proclaimed at once his station in society, and his
determination to maintain it.</p>
<p>The fair-sex appear also on their part to set all limits and
restraints at defiance.&nbsp; They seem to feel themselves at
perfect liberty to follow the prevailing mode, whatever that mode
may be.&nbsp; The consequence is, that <i>modesty</i> is often
the last thing considered by the young, and <i>propriety</i> as
completely neglected by the old.&nbsp; And this latter
circumstance may serve to account in some measure for the little
respect which is said to be paid to <i>age</i> in the Fashionable
World.&nbsp; To judge from the histories of all nations, it seems
impossible, that length <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>of days, if accompanied with those
characteristics which denote and become it, should not excite
spontaneous veneration.&nbsp; But if the shrivelled arm must be
bound in ribbands and bracelets, if the withered limbs must be
wrapped in muslins and gauzes, and the wrinkled face be decorated
with ringlets and furbelows, the silly veteran waves the
privilege of her years; and since she disgusts the grave, without
captivating the gay, she must not be surprized if she meets with
respect from neither.</p>
<p>A fondness for <i>amusements</i> is one of the strongest
characteristics of this people.&mdash;They may almost be said to
live for little else.&nbsp; They pass the whole of that short day
which they allow themselves, in making <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>arrangements for spending the ensuing night.&nbsp;
Indeed, their preference of night to day is such, that they seem
to consider the latter as having no other value than as it leads
to the former, and affords an opportunity of preparing for its
enjoyment.&nbsp; And hence I suppose it is, that such multitudes
among them dine by candle-light, and go to bed by day-light.</p>
<p>This passion for diversions renders the <i>Sunday</i>
particularly irksome to persons of any sort of <i>ton</i> in the
Fashionable World.&nbsp; A dose of piety in the morning is well
enough, though it is somewhat inconvenient to take it quite so
early; but then it wants an opera, or a play, or a dance, to
carry it off.&nbsp; There are indeed some <i>esprit-forts</i> <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>among the
ladies, who are trying with no little success to redeem a portion
of the Sabbath from the insufferable bondage of the Bible and the
sermon-book; and to naturalize that continental distribution of
the day, which gives the morning to devotion, and the evening to
dissipation.&nbsp; It is but justice to the gentlemen to say,
that they discover no backwardness in supporting a measure so
consonant to all their wishes.&nbsp; It is therefore not
impossible that some considerable changes in this respect may
soon be brought about.&nbsp; That good-humoured legislature which
has allowed a Sunday newspaper, <a name="citation116"></a><a
href="#footnote116" class="citation">[116]</a> will perhaps not
always refuse <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>a Sunday opera, or play.&nbsp; People of Fashion will
then no longer have to torture <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>their invention for expedients to
supply the absence of their diurnal diversions.&nbsp; They may
then let their tradesmen go quietly to their parish-churches,
instead of sending for them to wear away the sabbath-hours in
some supervacaneous employment.&nbsp; In short, Sunday may be set
at liberty from its primitive bondage, and exhibit as happy a
union of morning solemnity and evening licentiousness, as it has
ever displayed among the dissolute adherents of Fashionable
Christianity.</p>
<p>But to return:&mdash;The rage for amusements <a
name="citation119"></a><a href="#footnote119"
class="citation">[119]</a> <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>is so strong in this people, that it
seems to supersede all exercise of judgment <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>in the
choice and the conduct of them.&nbsp; To go every where, see
every thing, and know every body, are, in their estimation,
objects of such importance, that, in order to accomplish them,
they subject themselves to the greatest inconveniences, and
commit the very grossest absurdities.&nbsp; Hence they will rush
in crowds, to shine where they cannot be seen, to dance where
they cannot move, and to converse with friends whom they <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>cannot
approach; and, what is more, though they cannot breathe for the
pressure, and can scarcely live for the heat, yet they call
this&mdash;enjoyment.</p>
<p>Nor does this passion suffer any material abatement by the
progress of time.&nbsp; Many veterans visit, to the last, the
haunts of polite dissipation; they lend their countenance to
those dramas of vanity in which they can no longer act a part;
and show their incurable attachment to the pleasures of this
world, by their unwillingness to decline them.&nbsp; The
infirmities which attend upon the close of life are certainly
designed to produce other habits; and it should seem, that when
every thing announces an approaching dissolution, the amusements
of <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>the
drawing-room might give place to the employments of the
closet.&nbsp; Persons, however, of this description are of
another mind; and as every difficulty on the score of teeth,
hoariness, and wrinkles, can be removed by the happy expedients
of ivory, hair-caps, and cosmetics, there is certainly no
<i>physical</i> objection to their continuing among their
Fashionable acquaintance, till they are wanted in another
world.</p>
<p>I cannot illustrate this part of my subject better than by
presenting my readers with the following Ode on the Spring,
supposed to have been written by a man of Fashion; it expresses,
with so much exactness, the sentiments and taste of that
extraordinary people, that it will stand in the <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>place of a
thousand observations upon their character.</p>

127</span>CHAP. VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">HAPPINESS OF THE PEOPLE
ESTIMATED.</span></p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">trust</span> my reader is by this time
sufficiently acquainted with the general outline of Fashionable
life: it would only be accumulating observations unnecessarily to
enter further into the subject: I shall therefore devote the
present chapter to a brief investigation of the state of
happiness among a people who, it must be observed, claim to be
considered&mdash;the <i>happiest of their species</i>.</p>
<p>Happiness is, as moralists agree, a relative <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>expression;
and indicates the excess of the aggregate of good over that of
evil in any given condition.&nbsp; The foundation of happiness
therefore must be traced to the ideas which those, upon whose
condition the question turns, are accustomed to entertain, of
good and evil.&nbsp; So that if we wished to ascertain the amount
of happiness in a life of Fashion, we must make our calculation
out of those things, which constitute respectively good and evil
in a Fashionable estimation.&nbsp; I have had occasion to observe
before, that a Fashionable life is a life of sense; consequently
all the sources of happiness in such a condition must be confined
to the pleasures of sense.&nbsp; Now, it must be considered, that
the pains of sense are at least as numerous as its pleasures; <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>and that,
by a law of Providence subject to very few exceptions, those who
will have the one, must take their proportion of the other with
them.</p>
<p>This observation is abundantly confirmed by what occurs in the
experience of the parties under consideration.&nbsp; The
pleasures which men of Fashion derive from the gratification of
their animal appetites at the table, the gaming-house, and the
brothel, have a very ample set-off in the inconveniences which
they suffer from arthritic, nervous, and a thousand other,
painful and retributive complaints.&nbsp; Nor are the gay and
dissipated of the other sex exempted from the same contingency of
constitutional suffering.&nbsp; Beside the common lot of human <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>nature,
they have a class of evils of their own procuring; and, by
excesses as imprudent as they are immoral, they bring upon
themselves a variety of diseases, for which neither a name nor a
remedy can be found.&nbsp; There are those, it is true, who avoid
much of this inconvenience, by mixing some discretion with their
folly, and setting some bounds to their favourite gratifications:
but then it is to be remembered, that these are restraints which
render persons of licentious minds singularly uneasy; and they
may therefore be considered as administering to pain, nearly in
proportion as they abridge indulgence.</p>
<p>But supposing that we were to throw these severer items out of
the calculation: <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>there would still remain evils enough in a Fashionable
condition, to keep the scale from preponderating on the side of
pleasure.&nbsp; To shine in a ball-room, is, no doubt, a high
satisfaction; but then to be outshone by another, (which is just
as likely to happen,) is at least as great a mortification: to be
invited to <i>many</i> modish parties, is really delightful; but
then to know those who are invited to <i>more</i> than ourselves,
is certainly vexatious: to find one&rsquo;s-self surrounded by
people of the first Fashion, is charming; but then to be dying
with heat all the time, is something in the opposite scale; to
wear a coat or a head-dress of the newest invention, is indeed a
pleasure of the highest order; but then to see, by accident,
articles of the same mode on the back of a man-milliner, <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>or the head
of a lady&rsquo;s maid, is a species of vexation not easily
endured.&nbsp; An opera, a play, a party, a night passed at a
dance, or at a cassino, or a faro-table, are all events, to be
sure, of the happiest occurrence; but then, to be disappointed of
<i>one</i>, makes a deeper impression on the side of pain, than
to be gratified with <i>three</i>, does on that of pleasure: and
disappointments will happen, where many objects are pursued, and
where the concurrence of many instruments is necessary to their
accomplishment.&nbsp; A drunken coachman, a broken pannel, a sick
horse, a saucy footman, a mistaken message, a dull play,
indifferent company, a head-ach, a heart-burn, an epidemical
disease, or the dread of it, a death in the family, Sunday,
Fast-day, Passion <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>week, and a thousand other provoking casualties, either
deprive these entertainments of their power of pleasing, or even
set them wholly aside.&nbsp; I should only weary my reader were I
to lay before him in detail half the catalogue of those minor
distresses which embarrass the idea of a modish life: he must
however perceive, from the little which has been said, that every
pleasure has its countervailing pain; and that every sacrifice to
diversion and splendour has its correspondent chastisement in
vexation and disgrace.</p>
<p>Hitherto those principles have been assumed as the basis of
calculation, upon which people of Fashion have <i>some</i>
advantages in their favour; but there is another <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>ground upon
which (to say the whole truth) it ought to be put, and on which
all the advantages are <i>against</i> them.</p>
<p>Man (it is notorious) is a reflecting being; and, do what he
will, he <i>must</i> reflect.&nbsp; He may choose an
<i>habitual</i> career of sense; but still he must have, whether
he seek or shun them, moments of <i>Reflection</i>.&nbsp; This is
I admit, extremely inconvenient; but then it is without a
remedy.&nbsp; My business, however, is, neither to impugn, nor to
vindicate the existence of such a principle; but to show its
bearings upon the sort of life which people of Fashion must
necessarily lead.&nbsp; Not to enter into particulars, what can
constitute a heavier affliction, than for a man of Fashion (or,
which is the same thing, a man <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>of the world) to be obliged to think
over again the events of his licentious career?&nbsp; To be
persecuted with recollecting the property he has squandered, the
wine he has drunk, the seduction he has practised, and the duels
he has fought?&nbsp; These things were well enough at the time;
they had their humour and their reputation, and they were not
without their pleasure: but then they were designed to be
<i>acted</i>, and not <i>reflected</i> upon.&nbsp; The woman of
Fashion is under the same law, and is therefore exposed to the
same mental torments.&nbsp; She, too, must trace back (though she
would give the world to be excused) the steps she has trodden in
the enchanting walks of dissipation.&nbsp; She must live over
again every portion of a life which, though too fascinating <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>to be
declined, is yet too shocking to be thought of.&nbsp; Her memory,
also, must be haunted with frightful scenes, which remind her, at
the expence of how much health, and property, and time, and
virtue, she has sustained the figure which made her so talked of,
and the gaieties which rendered her so happy.&nbsp; Now these are
real afflictions; and that <i>Reflection</i> from which they
result is, not without reason, felt and acknowledged as the
scourge of their existence, by the ingenuous part, at least, of
the Fashionable World.</p>
<p>Many expedients have indeed been suggested for laying this
busy principle asleep, and many plans struck out for rendering
its pangs supportable; but hitherto without <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>success.&nbsp; For though it has been proposed to laugh
it away, dance it away, drink it away, or travel it away; yet not
one of these projects has answered the end: and Fashionable
casuists are as far as ever from finding out a remedy of
sufficient potency, to cure, or even abate, in any material
degree, the pains of Reflection.</p>
<p>And here I cannot but remark, how grievously the seat of this
disease (for such it is considered) has been mistaken by those
who have so lightly undertaken to prescribe for its
removal.&nbsp; They have manifestly considered it as a disorder
of the <i>nerves</i>; and hence all the remedies which they have
recommended, are calculated to promote, <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>either by
change of scene, or by some other mechanical impulse, a brisker
circulation of the animal spirits.&nbsp; The ill success with
which each has been attended, sufficiently proclaims the fallacy
upon which they all are founded.&nbsp; If Reflection had been
only a nervous disturbance, if it had arisen out of any
disarrangement of the <i>animal</i> economy, some, at least, of
the Fashionable nostrums would have dispersed the complaint:
whereas it is notorious, that, under every regimen which has been
tried, while the stronger symptoms have disappeared, the disorder
has remained in the system; and neither Bath, nor Weymouth, nor
Tunbridge, nor Town, has ever effected a cure.</p>
<p>The plain truth is, (whatever may be insinuated <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>to the
contrary by these <i>M&eacute;decins &agrave;-la-mode</i>,) that
the disease is altogether <i>moral</i>; and, consequently, the
seat of it is not in the nerves, but in the
<i>Conscience</i>.&nbsp; There is, in fact, nothing new in the
complaint: it is inseparably connected with a Fashionable career;
and has been more or less the scourge of all, in every age, who
have declined the duties which they owe &ldquo;to God and their
inferiors.&rdquo;&nbsp; I take it to have been a malady of the
very same description which afflicted Herod in his communication
with the Baptist, and which made Felix tremble under the
reasoning of Paul.&nbsp; It is not a little remarkable, that both
these men of Fashion (for such no doubt they were) fell into the
error which has been condemned, in the treatment of <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>their
disease; and each, there is reason to believe, carried it with
him to his grave.</p>
<p>If my reader now adverts to the particulars which have been
stated, he will be compelled to draw conclusions not a little
humbling to the lofty pretensions of a Fashionable life.&nbsp; In
few states of society, under its present imperfection, is
happiness very high: and it might not perhaps be easy to assign
the particular condition which embraces it in the greatest
proportion.&nbsp; But surely after the discoveries which this
discussion has made, we run no risk in affirming, that a life of
Fashion is <i>not</i> that condition.&nbsp; The lot of mankind
would be wretched indeed, if those were <i>the happiest of the
species</i>, who, without exemption <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>from the pains of sense, are
excluded from the pleasures of Reflection: and who, as the price
of enjoyments derived from the <i>one</i>, become subject to the
chastisement inflicted by <i>both</i>.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">DEFECT OF THE
SYSTEM&mdash;PLANS OF REFORM&mdash;CONCLUSION.</span></p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">system</span> which does so little for
the happiness of its members, as that which has been unfolded in
the course of this work, must have some radical defect; and it is
worthy of consideration, whether some steps should not be
speedily taken, in order to discover the nature of that defect,
and to provide a competent remedy for it.</p>
<p>I am perfectly aware, that it would be most decorous, to let
such a measure of <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>enquiry originate in the community to which it
primarily relates; and if I thought there was any chance of the
affair being taken up by the body, I should satisfy myself with
having intimated the necessity of such a procedure, and leave the
people of Fashion to reform themselves.</p>
<p>But I will honestly confess, that I see not at present any
prospect of such an event.&nbsp; It has not, so far as I can
understand, been hinted, in those assemblies which legislate for
the body, that the system of Fashion requires any revision: nor
can I discover, among the projected arrangements for future
seasons, any thing like a committee of reform.&nbsp; There is, on
the contrary, every reason to believe, that <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>designs of
a very different nature occupy the minds of those who influence
the community.&nbsp; I very much mistake, if it is not their
intention, to carry the system more extensively into effect; to
make still further conquests upon the puny domains of Wisdom and
Virtue; and to evince, by new modes of dissipation and new
excuses for adopting them, the endless perfectibility of Folly
and Vice.&nbsp; Under such circumstances, it will scarcely be
imputed to me as a trespass upon their privileges, if I venture
to perform that office for them, which they are never likely to
do for themselves.</p>
<p>I scruple not then to affirm, that <span
class="GutSmall">INCONSISTENCY</span> is the radical fault of the
Fashionable system.&nbsp; This truth is demonstrated <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>by every
thing that has been said upon their polity and laws, their
religion and morals, their plans of education, and their
institutes of life.&nbsp; Under every view which has been taken
of this people, they have exhibited appearances truly
paradoxical; and been found involved, from the beginning to the
end of their career, in the most palpable and extraordinary
contradictions.&nbsp; The fact indeed is, as their history has
shown, that the principles upon which they act, are essentially
at variance with each other; and the effect which these
principles have upon their conduct and their feelings, is only
such as might be expected, from an everlasting struggle for
mastery among them.&nbsp; The hand of this people is given to
Self-denial, but their <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>heart to Sensuality; and the manner
in which they are obliged to equivocate with both, will not allow
them the complete enjoyment of either.&nbsp; The libertinism they
practise shows them nothing but <i>this</i> world, the piety they
profess hides every thing from them but the world to <i>come</i>:
thus alternately impelled and restrained, deluded and undeceived,
they follow what they love, and condemn what they follow: neither
blind enough to be wholly led, nor discerning enough to see their
path;&mdash;with too much religion to let them be happy here, and
too little to make them so hereafter.</p>
<p>Now I see but two ways by which this <span
class="GutSmall">INCONSISTENCY</span> can be removed; and as I <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>wish to
make my work of some use to the people of whom it treats, I shall
briefly propose them in their order.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The <i>first</i> plan of <i>melioration</i> which I
would submit to the Fashionable World, is that of <i>renouncing
the Christian religion</i>.&nbsp; In recommending this step, I
proceed upon a supposition, that the government and laws and
manners which now prevail, must <i>at all events</i> be retained:
and upon such a supposition, I contend, that <i>renouncing the
Christian religion</i> is a measure of indispensable
necessity.&nbsp; For surely if duels must be fought, what can be
so preposterous as to swear allegiance to a law which
says&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Thou shalt not kill</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; If
injuries must <i>not</i> be forgiven, where is the propriety of
<a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>employing a prayer in which the petitioner declares,
that he does forgive them?&nbsp; If the passions are to be
<i>gratified</i>, what end is answered by doing homage to those
Scriptures which so peremptorily declare, that they must be
<i>mortified</i>?&nbsp; In a word, if swearing, prevarication,
and sensuality; if a neglect of &ldquo;the duties to God and
inferiors,&rdquo; be necessary, or even allowable, parts of a
Fashionable character; where is the policy, the virtue, or even
the decency, of connecting it with a religion which stamps these
several qualities with the deepest guilt, and threatens them with
the severest retribution?&nbsp; If a religion of <i>some</i> sort
be absolutely necessary, let such an one be chosen as may possess
a correspondence with the other parts of the system: let it be a
religion in <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>which pride, and resentment, and lust, may have their
necessary scope; a religion, in short, in which the God of this
world may be the idol, and the men of this world the
worshippers.&nbsp; Such an arrangement will go a great way
towards establishing <i>consistency</i>: it will dissolve a union
by which both parties are sufferers; and liberate at once the
people of Fashion from a profession which involves them in
contradiction, and Christianity from a connexion which covers her
with disgrace.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If, on the contrary, it should be thought material
(as I trust it will) <i>to retain Christianity at all events</i>,
the plan of reform must be exactly <i>inverted</i>; and the
sacrifices taken from those laws, and maxims, and <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>habits,
which interfere with the spirit and the injunctions of that holy
religion.&nbsp; It is altogether out of the character of
Christianity to act a subservient or an accommodating part.&nbsp;
Her nature, her office, and her object, are all decidedly adverse
to that base alliance into which it has been attempted to degrade
her.&nbsp; Pure and spotless as her native skies, she delights in
holiness; because God, from whose bosom she came, is holy.&nbsp;
Girt with power, and designed for dominion, she claims the heart
as her throne, and all the affections as the ministers of her
will: nor does she consider her object accomplished until she has
cast down every lofty imagination, extinguished every rebellious
lust, and brought into captivity every thought to the obedience
<a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>of
Christ.&nbsp; It is obvious, therefore, that if she is to be
retained at all, it must be upon her <i>own</i> terms; and those
terms will manifestly require an utter renunciation of every
measure which, under the former plan, it was proposed to
retain.&nbsp; Duels must <i>now</i> no longer be fought, nor
injuries resentfully pursued, nor licentious passions
deliberately gratified.&nbsp; Swearing must be banished from the
lips, prevarication from the thoughts, sensuality from the heart;
and that law be expunged, which dispenses with &ldquo;the duties
to God and inferiors,&rdquo; in order to make way for that
immutable statute which enjoins them.</p>
<p>It must not be dissembled, that, in the progress of such a
reform, certain inconveniences <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>will be unavoidably encountered; but
these will be speedily and effectually compensated by an influx
of real and permanent advantages.&nbsp; The pangs which
accompanied the &ldquo;death unto sin,&rdquo; will soon be
forgotten in the pleasures which result from a &ldquo;life unto
righteousness;&rdquo; and the peace and hope which abound in the
way, will efface the recollection of those agonistic efforts by
which it was entered.</p>
<p>In the mean time, all things will be done with decency and
order.&nbsp; The whole economy of life and conduct will be
scrupulously consulted; and such arrangements introduced, as will
make the several parts and details correspond and harmonize <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>with each
other.&nbsp; Duty and recreation will have their proper
characters, and times, and places, and limits.&nbsp; Every thing,
in short, will be preserved in the system, which can facilitate
intercourse without impairing virtue; and nothing be struck out
but what administers to vanity, duplicity, and vice.</p>
<p>Whether changes of such magnitude as those which I have
described, will ever take place upon an extensive scale, I cannot
pretend to conjecture; but certain I am, that, if ever they
should, not only the Fashionable World, but society at large,
will be very much the better for them.&nbsp; Greatly as I wish
the &ldquo;Reformation of Manners,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
Suppression of Vice,&rdquo; I see insuperable <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>obstacles
to each of these events, while rank, and station, and wealth,
throw their mighty influence into the opposite scale.&nbsp;
Then&mdash;<i>and not till then</i>&mdash;will Christianity
receive the homage she deserves, and produce the blessings she
has promised&mdash;when &ldquo;the makers of our manners&rdquo;
shall submit to her authority; and the <span
class="GutSmall">PEOPLE</span> of <span
class="smcap">Fashion</span> become the <span
class="GutSmall">PEOPLE</span> of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES.</h2>
<p><a name="footnote5"></a><a href="#citation5"
class="footnote">[5]</a>&nbsp; For the geographical solecism of
&ldquo;a western <i>latitude</i>,&rdquo; the author has only to
plead, that the people of whom he treats, acknowledge no points
of the compass but those of <i>east</i> and <i>west</i>; and that
the term <i>longitude</i> has scarcely any place in their
language.</p>
<p><a name="footnote10"></a><a href="#citation10"
class="footnote">[10]</a>&nbsp; This <i>somehow</i> and
<i>somewhere</i> existence of people of Fashion might lead a
stranger to suppose, that they have no permanent
dwelling-place.&nbsp; He must, however, be told, that, while they
are thus migrating from place to place, without comfort, and
without respect, many of them are actually turning their backs
upon the conveniences of a family mansion, and the consequence of
a dependent tenantry.&nbsp; This disposition to emigration in
persons of distinction, has been so admirably noticed in a late
elegant and interesting work, that I cannot refuse myself the
pleasure of transcribing the passage.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That there exists at present amongst us a
lamentable want of rural philosophy, or of that wisdom which
teaches a man at once to enjoy and to improve a life of
retirement, is, I think, a point too obvious to be
contested.&nbsp; Whence is it else, that the ancient mansions of
our nobility and gentry, notwithstanding all the attractions of
rural beauty, and every elegance of accommodation, can no longer
retain their owners, who, <i>at the approach of winter</i>,
<i>pour into the metropolis</i>, <i>and even in the summer months
wander to the sea-coast or to some other place of Fashionable
resort</i>?&nbsp; This unsettled humour, in the midst of such
advantages, plainly argues much inward disorder, and points out
the need as well as the excellency of that discipline which can
inspire a pure taste of nature, furnish occupation in the
peaceful labours of husbandry, and, what is nobler still, open
the sources of moral and intellectual
enjoyment.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Preface to Rural Philosophy</i>,

transaction, see the trial of Captain Macnamara for the murder of
Colonel Montgomery; in which it will appear, that though the
Captain admitted <i>the fact</i>, yet the jury acquitted him of
the <i>crime</i>.&nbsp; Such complaisance on the part of juries
is particularly favourable to this summary mode of terminating
differences.&nbsp; Fatal duels are now become almost as common as
highway robberies, and make almost as little impression upon the
public mind.&nbsp; The <i>murdered</i> is carried to his grave,
and the <i>murderer</i> received back into society, with the same
honour, as if the one had done his duty in sacrificing his life,

Fashionable people that ever assembled for a similar purpose
within the walls of a church, that I shall avail myself of the

is now approaching, in which the gaieties and amusements of this
vast metropolis are generally engaged in with incredible alacrity
and ardour, and multitudes are pouring in from every part of the
kingdom to take their share in them; and when I recollect
further, that at this very period in the last year, a degree of
extravagance and wildness of pleasure took place, which gave pain
to every serious mind, and was almost unexampled in any former
times, I am not, I confess, without some apprehensions that the
same scenes of levity and dissipation may again recur; and that
some of those who now hear me (of the younger part more
especially) may be drawn too far into this Fashionable vortex,
and lose, in that giddy tumult of diversion, all remembrance of
what has passed in this sacred place.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Bp Porteus

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
